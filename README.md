This repository holds various models that accompany our paper 'modular datat refinement' and the technique described in that paper.

There are three major folders in this repository:

<dl>
<dt>Audacity</dt>
  <dd>Holds the various models that were used to describe the essential structure of the Audacity audio editing application.</dd>
<dt>Alloy</dt>
  <dd>Has a set of files that fully develop a very simple resource manager model in a modular style.</dd>
<dt>Zed</dt>
<dd>Has a single LaTeX file with a Z model of the same resource manager.</dd>
</dl>

We hope that this collection of models will make it easier to understand the technique and that it could be used as 
a guiding example for a modular development of your own formal models.
